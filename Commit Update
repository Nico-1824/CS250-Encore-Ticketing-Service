On the test plan excel sheet, I did 3 tests to be done by the development team. I wrote the test plan to test if a user can sign into account and the webpage allows access to the correct user.
I also wrote the test plan to test the theater locater and verify that the webpage shows all available theaters in the area for a user to click on. The last test plan I wrote the admin login 
to verify an admin can log into an admin account and manipulate webpage data.
